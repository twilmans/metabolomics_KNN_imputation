# metabolomics_KNN_imputation
The code was written in Python using Jupyter Notebooks. It takes a plasma metabolomics dataset with missing values and optimizes the KNN imputation.

The code was used as part of a larger project exploring how to predict personalized statin drug responses through sequencing the gut microbiome.
